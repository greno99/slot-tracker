# 🔧 OCR Resolution Fix for Your 2560x1440 Monitor

## The Problem You Found ✅

You were absolutely correct! The OCR issue is caused by **resolution calculation problems**.

**Your Setup:**
- Monitor: 2560x1440 (native resolution)  
- App Screenshots: 1920x1080 (hardcoded in the code)
- Area Selection: Done at 2560x1440 coordinates
- OCR Extraction: Tried to extract from 1920x1080 screenshot using 2560x1440 coordinates

**The Math:**
- Scaling factor: 1920÷2560 = 0.75 (X-axis)
- Scaling factor: 1080÷1440 = 0.75 (Y-axis)
- Your selected areas were 25% off target!

## The Solution 🎯

I've created an automated fix that:

1. **Detects your native 2560x1440 resolution automatically**
2. **Captures screenshots at full 2560x1440 resolution** (no more scaling issues)
3. **Uses exact coordinates from area selection** (no coordinate translation needed)
4. **Provides fallback scaling** (for other resolution monitors)

## How to Apply the Fix 🚀

### Step 1: Run the Automated Fix
```bash
cd C:\Users\Joshua\OneDrive\Dokumente\programming\slot-tracker
node fix-resolution.js
```

### Step 2: Test the Fix
```bash
node test-resolution-fix.js
```

### Step 3: Test Your OCR
1. Restart your app
2. Open the OCR setup window  
3. **Delete your old area configurations** (they have wrong coordinates)
4. Configure new OCR areas
5. Test OCR - it should now work perfectly!

## What Files Were Fixed 📁

The automated fix updates:
- `main.js` - Dynamic resolution detection, coordinate handling
- `screenshot-capture.js` - Native resolution capture
- Creates `test-resolution-fix.js` - Test script
- Creates `RESOLUTION-FIX-README.md` - Detailed documentation

## Expected Results After Fix ✨

**Before Fix:**
```
📺 Monitor: 2560x1440
📸 Screenshot: 1920x1080 (scaled down)
📍 Area selected: (1356, 1079)
🔍 OCR looks at: (1017, 809) ❌ Wrong location!
```

**After Fix:**
```
📺 Monitor: 2560x1440
📸 Screenshot: 2560x1440 (native resolution)  
📍 Area selected: (1356, 1079)
🔍 OCR looks at: (1356, 1079) ✅ Exact match!
```

## Console Messages You Should See 👀

When the fix works correctly, you'll see:
```
📺 Detected monitor resolution: 2560x1440
🎯 Using native resolution for OCR accuracy
✅ No coordinate scaling needed - using native resolution
```

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

If OCR still doesn't work after the fix:

1. **Check console logs** - Make sure you see the "🎯 Using native resolution" message
2. **Delete old configurations** - Old area configs have wrong coordinates
3. **Configure new areas** - After applying the fix, select new OCR areas
4. **Restart the app** - Make sure changes take effect

## Why This Fix Works 🧠

The problem was exactly as you suspected - **wrong desktop resolution calculations**. The app was:

1. Taking screenshots at 1920x1080 (75% of your actual resolution)
2. But using coordinates selected at 2560x1440 (100% resolution)
3. Result: 25% coordinate mismatch

The fix eliminates this scaling issue by capturing at your native resolution, so coordinates match exactly.

## Safe to Use 🛡️

- Creates automatic backups of modified files
- Only changes resolution handling code
- Doesn't affect other app functionality  
- Can be tested safely with the test script

Your analysis was spot-on! This should completely resolve your OCR area selection issues. 🎯

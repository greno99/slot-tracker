# DXGI Error Fixed - Enhanced Screenshot Capture

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ

Your DXGI error has been fixed! The error you were seeing:
```
IDXGIDuplicateOutput does not use RGBA (8 bit) format, which is required by downstream components, format is 10
```

This was caused by Windows using a 10-bit HDR display format instead of the 8-bit RGBA format that Electron's `desktopCapturer` expects.

## Solution Implemented üîß

I've implemented a **Enhanced Screenshot Capture System** that automatically tries multiple capture methods:

### 1. Enhanced Screenshot Capture (`screenshot-capture.js`)
- **Method 1**: Electron desktopCapturer (fastest, but fails with DXGI errors)
- **Method 2**: PowerShell with Windows .NET APIs (handles DXGI errors)
- **Method 3**: Python PIL fallback (if available)

### 2. Updated OCR Engine (`ocr-engine.js`)
- Added `analyzeScreenArea()` method that directly captures screen areas
- Integrated with the enhanced screenshot capture system
- Better error handling and debugging

### 3. Updated Detection Engine (`main.js`)
- Uses enhanced OCR for both live detection and testing
- Better error reporting and fallback handling
- Detailed debugging information

## How It Works Now üöÄ

1. **Automatic Fallback**: When Electron's capture fails with DXGI error, the system automatically switches to PowerShell capture
2. **Better OCR**: Direct screen area capture with image enhancement
3. **Detailed Logging**: See which capture method is being used
4. **Real Values**: No more fallback demo values - actual OCR from your screen!

## Testing Your Fix üß™

1. Open the **Spin Detection Setup** window
2. Configure your OCR areas (bet, win, balance)
3. Click **"üî¨ OCR testen"**
4. You should now see:
   - **Real OCR results** (not 0.00 fallback values)
   - **Capture method used** (PowerShell, Electron, or Python)
   - **Confidence levels** for each detected area

## Expected Results ‚ú®

After the fix, you should see output like:
```
‚úÖ ENHANCED OCR bet: "2.50" -> 2.5 (85% confidence via POWERSHELL)
‚úÖ ENHANCED OCR win: "15.75" -> 15.75 (92% confidence via POWERSHELL)  
‚úÖ ENHANCED OCR balance: "234.50" -> 234.5 (88% confidence via POWERSHELL)
```

## Debug Information üîç

The system will now tell you:
- Which capture method is working: `ELECTRON`, `POWERSHELL`, or `PYTHON`
- OCR confidence levels for each area
- Detailed error messages if something fails
- Screenshots saved in `/debug-ocr/` folder for analysis

## What to Try Now üìã

1. **Configure Areas**: Set up your OCR areas precisely around visible numbers
2. **Test OCR**: Use the test button to verify OCR is working
3. **Start Detection**: Begin live spin detection
4. **Check Logs**: Look for "ENHANCED OCR" messages in the console

The DXGI error should no longer prevent OCR from working, as the PowerShell capture method bypasses Electron's problematic desktop capturer entirely!

## Additional Tips üí°

- **For best results**: Make sure OCR areas contain clear, readable numbers
- **Area size**: Not too small (minimum 10x5px) but not too large
- **Contrast**: Better contrast = better OCR accuracy
- **Multiple methods**: The system will automatically use the best available capture method

Your OCR should now work properly and read actual values from your casino screen! üé∞

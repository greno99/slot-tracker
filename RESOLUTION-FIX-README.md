# Resolution Fix for 2560x1440 Monitor

This fix resolves the OCR area selection issue where coordinates selected at your native 2560x1440 resolution weren't matching the 1920x1080 screenshots.

## What was the problem?

Your monitor: **2560x1440**  
App screenshots: **1920x1080** (hardcoded)  
Result: Area coordinates were misaligned by ~25%

## What was fixed:

1. **Dynamic Resolution Detection**: App now detects your native 2560x1440 resolution
2. **Native Resolution Capture**: Screenshots are now taken at 2560x1440 for maximum OCR accuracy  
3. **Proper Coordinate Handling**: No more scaling mismatches between area selection and OCR

## Files modified:

- `main.js` - Added dynamic resolution detection and coordinate scaling
- `screenshot-capture.js` - Updated to use native resolution
- `test-resolution-fix.js` - Test script to verify the fix

## How to test:

1. Run `node test-resolution-fix.js` to verify resolution detection
2. Start your app and open the OCR setup window
3. Configure new OCR areas (delete old ones first)
4. Test OCR - it should now correctly read the selected areas

## Before/After:

**Before**: Area selected at (1356, 1079) but OCR looked at (1017, 809) ‚ùå  
**After**: Area selected at (1356, 1079) and OCR reads from (1356, 1079) ‚úÖ

## Troubleshooting:

If OCR still doesn't work correctly:
1. Delete old area configurations (they have the wrong coordinates)
2. Configure new areas after applying this fix
3. Check the console logs for resolution detection messages
4. Make sure you see "üéØ Using native resolution for OCR accuracy"

Your OCR should now work perfectly with your 2560x1440 monitor! üéØ
